Julia is a high-level language, similar to MATLAB and Python, but makes use of a powerful compiler that generates faster code. The Julia community is continuing to grow and the language is now able to target GPUs as well as typical processors. This project aims to further extend the reach of the Julia language to heterogeneous compute platforms like Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). High Level
Synthesis is a method of digital hardware development that allows a user to transform high-level language source code into low-level hardware. This improves the accessibility of hardware acceleration by abstracting much of the hardware complexity away from the developer. This project details the initial development stages of a High Level Synthesis framework for the Julia Language. The flow supports several base Julia functions as well as complex branching and looping. This
was successfully tested in simulation, verifying that the generated VHDL hardware was functionally correct.
